Instagif
===================

A Rails web application that uses the GIPHY API.

Instagif allows users to generate gifs based on a word or phrase of their choice, which is then displayed on a public stream.

Run `rake db:migrate` to create the databases, then run `rails s` and visit `localhost:3000` on your browser to begin instagif-ing!
